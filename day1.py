###How are NumPy Arrays better than Lists in Python?  
'''The arrays created with NumPy are more compact than Python Lists.
Accessing arrays and reading and writing elements to arrays is comparatively faster than doing the same in Python Lists.
The arrays created in NumPy are more efficient and convenient to use.NumPy provides more functionality than the list '''
